# Android-App_development
One of my client wanted to convert his website into android app. Just a webview, so if he update this site it should update the app too. So searched google a lot and found planty of code. I modified something and tried with android studio.  And I found its working. So I create a tutorial, how I made this. Many people liked the video and asked for the code. So I think I should create a repository.
