# Android-App_development
One of my clients wanted to convert his website into an android app. Just a webview, so if he updates this site it should update the app too. So searched google a lot and found plenty of code. I modified something and tried with android studio. And I found it working. So I create a tutorial, how I made this. Many people liked the video and asked for the code. So I think I should create a repository.

Here is tutorial link
